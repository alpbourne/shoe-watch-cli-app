# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application: I have implemented several prompts in the ./lib/shoe_watch_cli_app/cli.rb file. The user is able to type in their responses to the prompts. The user is able to request more details, see the list again, and exit.
- [x] Pull data from an external source: Data for specific shoes is pulled from Nike and Under Armour websites.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views: The user is first presented with a list, then they are given the option to see details for the shoe type they are interested in.
